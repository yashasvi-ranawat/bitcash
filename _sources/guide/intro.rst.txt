Introduction
============

BitCash is a fast and compliant Bitcoin Cash library with an extremely easy-to-use API.

Why BitCash?
------------

- Robust API with sane defaults, making development a breeze
- Python's fastest available implementation (100x faster than closest library)
- Compliant to implemented Bitcoin Improvement Protocols
- Available on all major platforms
- Extensive documentation

Python's Bitcoin story was pretty bleak. All libraries in use prior to bit were
marred by unfriendly APIs, lack of testing, lack of documentation, lack of
cross-platform support, and/or slow implementations.

When Ofek originally went to experiment with sending Bitcoin there were really no
good choices. Two choices were out almost immediately: `pybitcointools`_ was
`scary`_, unpleasant to use, and not very maintained, while `python_bitcoinlib`_,
was far too low level. That left `pycoin`_, which was a bit better but still no docs, and 2 libraries from VC funded companies: `two1`_ from `21`_, which had
decent documentation but had an incorrect implementation of the standardized
compressed public keys (meaning such keys could literally not spend money), and
`pybitcoin`_ from `Blockstack`_ which did not support Python 3 and had limited
docs.

All of these libraries are also slow. Let's take a look at some common operations.

Instantiate a compressed private key and get its computed public key:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m timeit -s "from bitcash import Key" "Key('L3jsepcttyuJK3HKezD4qqRKGtwc8d2d1Nw6vsoPDX9cMcUxqqMv').public_key"
    1000 loops, best of 3: 89 usec per loop
    $ python -m timeit -s "from two1.bitcoincash.crypto import PrivateKey" "PrivateKey.from_b58check('L3jsepcttyuJK3HKezD4qqRKGtwc8d2d1Nw6vsoPDX9cMcUxqqMv').public_key.compressed_bytes"
    100 loops, best of 3: 11 msec per loop
    $ python -m timeit -s "from pycoin.key import Key" "Key.from_text('L3jsepcttyuJK3HKezD4qqRKGtwc8d2d1Nw6vsoPDX9cMcUxqqMv').sec()"
    10 loops, best of 3: 48.2 msec per loop
    (py2) >python -m timeit -s "from pybitcoin import BitcoinPrivateKey" "BitcoinCashPrivateKey('c28a9f80738f770d527803a566cf6fc3edf6cea586c4fc4a5223a5ad797e1ac3').public_key().to_hex()"
    10 loops, best of 3: 190 msec per loop

We'll use two1 only as that was the closest to bit. Getting the address:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m timeit -s "from bitcash import Key;k=Key()" "k.address"
    1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.249 usec per loop
    $ python -m timeit -s "from two1.bitcoin.crypto import PrivateKey;k=PrivateKey.from_random()" "k.public_key.address()"
    10000 loops, best of 3: 31.1 usec per loop

Signing, which is the most used operation:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m timeit -s "from bitcash import Key;k=Key()" "k.sign(b'data')"
    1000 loops, best of 3: 91 usec per loop
    $ python -m timeit -s "from two1.bitcoin.crypto import PrivateKey;k=PrivateKey.from_random()" "k.raw_sign(b'data')"
    100 loops, best of 3: 10.7 msec per loop

.. note::

    The author of pycoin `has informed Ofek <https://github.com/ofek/bitcash/issues/4>`_
    that a flag can be set on Linux to make some operations faster.
